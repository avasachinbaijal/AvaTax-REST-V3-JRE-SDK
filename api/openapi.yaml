        The transaction and its lines must meet the following criteria in order to be evaluated:
        * The transaction must be recorded. Using a type of *SalesInvoice* is recommended.
        * A parameter with the name *AlcoholRouteType* must be specified and the value must be one of the following: '*DTC*', '*Retailer DTC*'
        * A parameter with the name *RecipientName* must be specified and the value must be the name of the recipient.
        * Each alcohol line must include a *ContainerSize* parameter that describes the volume of a single container. Use the *unit* field to specify one of the following units: '*Litre*', '*Millilitre*', '*gallon (US fluid)*', '*quart (US fluid)*', '*ounce (fluid US customary)*'
        * Each alcohol line must include a *PackSize* parameter that describes the number of containers in a pack. Specify *Count* in the *unit* field.

        Optionally, the transaction and its lines may use the following parameters:
        * The *ShipDate* parameter may be used if the date of shipment is different than the date of the transaction. The value should be ISO-8601 compliant (e.g. 2020-07-21).
        * The *RecipientDOB* parameter may be used to evaluate age restrictions. The value should be ISO-8601 compliant (e.g. 2020-07-21).
        * The *PurchaserDOB* parameter may be used to evaluate age restrictions. The value should be ISO-8601 compliant (e.g. 2020-07-21).
        * The *SalesLocation* parameter may be used to describe whether the sale was made *OnSite* or *OffSite*. *OffSite* is the default value.
        * The *AlcoholContent* parameter may be used to describe the alcohol percentage by volume of the item. Specify *Percentage* in the *unit* field.
